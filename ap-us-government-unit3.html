        </div>

        <div class="topic">
            <h2>Understanding Civil Liberties</h2>
            <p><strong>Civil liberties</strong> are constitutional protections that prevent the government from interfering with individual freedoms. These rights ensure that the government doesn't overreach and that people remain protected from government abuse.</p>
            
            <h3>The Bill of Rights</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Bill of Rights</strong> consists of the Constitution's first ten amendments, intended to protect basic freedoms from government interference.</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <strong>Key Distinction:</strong> Originally, the Bill of Rights only applied to the federal government, not state governments. This changed through the <strong>Incorporation Doctrine</strong>, which gradually applied these rights to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="topic">
            <h2>First Amendment Freedoms</h2>
            
            <h3>The Five Freedoms</h3>
            <p>The <strong>First Amendment</strong> protects five fundamental freedoms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freedom of Religion</strong> – Everyone can follow the religion of their choice</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom of Speech</strong> – Protection of verbal and written expression</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom of the Press</strong> – Media can operate without government censorship</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom of Assembly</strong> – People can gather peacefully</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom to Petition</strong> – Citizens can ask the government to address grievances</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Religion Clauses</h3>
            <h4>Establishment Clause</h4>
            <p>The government cannot support, favor, or establish an official religion. This maintains the separation of church and state, often called the <strong>wall-of-separation principle</strong>.</p>
            
            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Engel v. Vitale</strong> – Banned school-led prayer in public schools, ruling that it violated the Establishment Clause.
            </div>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Lemon v. Kurtzman</strong> – Created the Lemon Test for church-state cases. Government action must: (1) have a secular purpose, (2) not primarily advance or inhibit religion, and (3) not create excessive government entanglement with religion.
            </div>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Abington v. Schempp</strong> – Schools cannot conduct sponsored Bible readings.
            </div>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Zelman v. Simmons-Harris</strong> – School vouchers can be used at religious schools without violating the Establishment Clause.
            </div>

            <h4>Free Exercise Clause</h4>
            <p>Protects your right to practice your religion freely without government interference.</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <strong>Conscientious Objector:</strong> An individual who refuses to fight in war due to moral or religious reasons, protected under free exercise principles.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Released Time:</strong> Students are allowed to leave school for religious instruction.</p>

            <h3>Freedom of Speech</h3>
            <p><strong>Freedom of expression</strong> covers not just words, but also actions that communicate a message.</p>

            <h4>Limits on Speech</h4>
            <div class="key-concept">
                <strong>Clear and Present Danger Test:</strong> If speech creates an immediate, clear threat to public safety, it can be limited.
            </div>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Schenck v. United States</strong> – Established that during wartime, there are limits on free speech when it poses a clear and present danger.
            </div>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Gitlow v. New York</strong> – Started applying free speech protections to state governments through the Fourteenth Amendment.
            </div>

            <h4>Symbolic Speech</h4>
            <p><strong>Symbolic speech</strong> refers to actions that represent a message, such as wearing armbands or burning a flag.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Texas v. Johnson</strong> – Flag burning is protected symbolic speech under the First Amendment.
            </div>

            <h4>Commercial Speech</h4>
            <p><strong>Commercial speech</strong> includes advertising and content meant to sell products. It's protected, but not as strongly as political speech.</p>

            <h4>Obscenity</h4>
            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Roth v. United States</strong> – Obscene material is not protected by free speech.
            </div>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Miller v. California</strong> – Set the three-part test for determining what counts as obscene material.
            </div>

            <h3>Freedom of the Press</h3>
            <h4>Prior Restraint</h4>
            <p><strong>Prior restraint</strong> occurs when the government tries to stop speech or publication before it happens. This is generally unconstitutional.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Near v. Minnesota</strong> – The government usually cannot censor something before it's published.
            </div>

            <h4>Libel and Public Figures</h4>
            <p><strong>Libel</strong> refers to written false statements that harm someone's reputation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Actual malice</strong> means intentionally lying or recklessly disregarding the truth. Public officials must prove actual malice in libel cases.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>New York Times v. Sullivan</strong> – Public officials must prove actual malice to win libel cases, protecting robust debate about public figures.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Public figures</strong> are people in the spotlight who have less protection from criticism than private individuals.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Miami Herald v. Tornillo</strong> – The government cannot force newspapers to print opposing viewpoints.
            </div>

            <h4>Broadcast Media Regulation</h4>
            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Red Lion v. FCC</strong> – Allowed regulation of broadcast media because airwaves are a limited public resource.
            </div>

            <h3>Freedom of Association</h3>
            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>NAACP v. Alabama</strong> – Protected freedom of association and the right to privacy in organizational membership.
            </div>

            <h3>Historical Context: Suppression of Speech</h3>
            <p><strong>Sedition Act</strong> – Criminalized speaking or writing critically about the government.</p>
            <p><strong>Smith Act</strong> – Made it illegal to advocate overthrowing the government.</p>
            <p><strong>Communist Control Act</strong> – A Cold War law aimed at limiting communist political activity.</p>
            <p><strong>Internal Security Act</strong> – Required communist groups to register with the government.</p>
            <p><strong>Red Scare</strong> – A period when Americans were intensely afraid of communism due to its rapid global spread.</p>

            <h3>Preferred Position Doctrine</h3>
            <p>First Amendment rights receive <strong>preferred position</strong> – they get extra protection compared to other rights because they're fundamental to democracy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic">
            <h2>Rights of the Accused</h2>
            
            <h3>Fourth Amendment: Search and Seizure</h3>
            <p>Protects against <strong>unreasonable searches and seizures</strong>. You can't be searched without proper cause.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Probable cause</strong> is a reasonable belief that a crime has occurred, not just a hunch.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Search warrant</strong> is a court order that allows police to search a specific place.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Mapp v. Ohio</strong> – Established the exclusionary rule at the state level: evidence obtained illegally cannot be used in court.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Exclusionary rule</strong> means that if police find evidence illegally, they cannot use it in court.</p>

            <p><strong>Good-faith exception</strong> allows evidence to be used if police honestly believed they were following the law, even if technically they weren't.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Zurcher v. Stanford Daily</strong> – Police can search newsrooms if they have a valid warrant.
            </div>

            <h3>Fifth Amendment: Self-Incrimination and Due Process</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Fifth Amendment</strong> provides several protections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to remain silent</strong> (protection against self-incrimination)</li>
                <li><strong>Due process</strong> – Government must follow fair procedures</li>
                <li><strong>No double jeopardy</strong> – Can't be tried twice for the same crime</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Self-incrimination</strong> is the right not to testify against yourself and to remain silent.</p>

            <p><strong>Due Process Clause</strong> requires the government to follow fair rules before punishing someone.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Miranda v. Arizona</strong> – Police must inform suspects of their rights (right to remain silent, right to an attorney) before questioning.
            </div>

            <h3>Sixth Amendment: Right to Counsel and Fair Trial</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Sixth Amendment</strong> guarantees every criminal defendant:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>fair and speedy trial</strong></li>
                <li>An <strong>impartial jury</strong></li>
                <li>The right to an <strong>attorney</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Gideon v. Wainwright</strong> – The state must provide a lawyer if you cannot afford one.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Plea bargaining</strong> occurs when defendants plead guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence, often because they believe they won't win at trial.</p>

            <h3>Eighth Amendment: Cruel and Unusual Punishment</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Eighth Amendment</strong> protects against cruel and unusual punishment. Punishments cannot be extreme or inhumane.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Gregg v. Georgia</strong> – The death penalty is constitutional, but only under specific, fair procedures.
            </div>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>McCleskey v. Kemp</strong> – The Court did not overturn the death penalty despite evidence of racial bias in sentencing.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="topic">
            <h2>The Right to Privacy</h2>
            <p>The <strong>right to privacy</strong> is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, but the Supreme Court has recognized it as implied by several amendments.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Roe v. Wade</strong> – Established a constitutional right to abortion based on the right to privacy. The Court ruled that states could not ban abortion in the first trimester.
            </div>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</strong> – Modified Roe by prohibiting states from banning abortion before fetal viability, but allowed some restrictions.
            </div>

            <h3>National Security and Privacy</h3>
            <p><strong>FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)</strong> allows secret courts to approve surveillance for national security reasons, balancing privacy with security concerns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic">
            <h2>Key Constitutional Amendments</h2>
            <p><strong>Fourteenth Amendment</strong> – Applies rights to the states through the Due Process Clause and guarantees equal protection under the law. This amendment is central to the incorporation doctrine.</p>

            <p><strong>Incorporation Doctrine</strong> – The process of applying the Bill of Rights protections to state governments through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

            <div class="case-box">
                <strong>Barron v. Baltimore</strong> – Early case establishing that the Bill of Rights originally did not apply to state governments, only to the federal government.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="topic">
            <h2>Balancing Rights and Government Interests</h2>
            <p><strong>Least restrictive means</strong> – When the government restricts rights, it must use the least restrictive method to achieve its legitimate goal.</p>
            
            <div class="key-concept">
                <strong>Balancing Test:</strong> Courts often balance individual liberties against government interests in public safety, national security, and order. The government must show a compelling reason to restrict fundamental rights.
